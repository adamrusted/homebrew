Unlike gods of flame who bring warmth or rebirth, Ikaris is fire's spiteful scream — uncontrolled, mindless, and starving.", "He is depicted as a charred warrior wrapped in ever-burning bandages, his face a skull of cracked obsidian, his voice the roar of collapsing towers. His followers do not conquer; they burn and salt the earth. His apocalyptic sermons scorch stone and are spoken by tongues blackened to ash."]
